        <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are being used in the medical industry to improve medical imaging, drug discovery, and patient outcomes. AI and ML can analyze large datasets and identify patterns and trends that are not
            visible to the human eye. This can lead to faster and more accurate diagnoses, improved drug efficacy, and better patient outcomes. AI and ML are also being used to develop predictive models that can identify patients at risk of developing
            certain medical conditions or complications. This allows doctors to intervene early and prevent or manage the condition before it becomes more severe. However, AI and ML have their limitations, and they are not perfect. They can make errors
            and biases if not properly calibrated, and they are not a replacement for human expertise and judgement. In conclusion, AI and ML have the potential to transform the medical industry and improve patient outcomes. They offer a powerful tool
            for analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and trends that are not visible to the human eye. However, their limitations and biases need to be addressed, and they should be used in conjunction with human expertise and judgement.</p>
